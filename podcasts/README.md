# Extract feeds from the OPML file
feeds = manager.extract_feeds()

# Add a new feed to the OPML file
manager.add_feed('New Feed', 'https://example.com/feed.xml')

# Remove a feed from the OPML file
manager.remove_feed_by_url('https://example.com/feed.xml')

# Save the changes made to the OPML file
